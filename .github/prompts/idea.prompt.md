Can you create ui for codifying plugin?
Requirements:

- selected instance list (no need to collapse, it should be in scrolling frame with horizonal and vertical scrollability)
- you should be able to see the total amount of selected instances
- you should be able to enable/disable instances for codifying (check mark, if toggled - will exlude the instance and it's descendants)
- button codify that will convert selected instance to code
- the code should be in the output window (textbox, ClearOnFocus disabled, and make that user cant edit the text aka disable TextEdiable and enable it only for the moment when you write text [code] in the output)
- there should be a button that will focus user on the textbox (output window) and will select the text from start to finish that user will be able to copy
- add checkmark that will toggle output to output window or simply with print()
- implement necessary components
- separate constants in the resources
